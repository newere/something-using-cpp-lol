This is a simple skeleton for RPG player-selection/customizer-thing project. The main idea behind this was to make a inventory system but I just happened to create the whole player thing. 
This is the 4th iteration or v4.
There have obviously been past iterations.
This iteration focuses on maintaining clean code, implementing RAII, proper memory management and not using "this->".

The 4th iteration is not complete yet and there are a lot more things i want to add to this.
fstream has been implemented..
item headerfile has been changed..

With this, the project is complete, not perfect but complete. This is a throw-away project afterall.
