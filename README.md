This is a simple skeleton for RPG player-selection/customizer-thing project. The main idea behind this was to make a inventory system but I just happened to create the whole player thing. 
This is the 4th iteration or v4.
There have obviously been past iterations.
This iteration focuses on maintaining clean code, implementing RAII, proper memory management and not using "this->".

The 4th iteration is not complete yet and there are a lot more things i want to add to this.
The main thing i want to add to this is the storage of user data using fstream, but its really boring so i had been putting it off. The program has grown well enough to keep putting it aside.
There are also a lot of things this iteration changed, so most of the item headerfile needs to be rewritten.
